# CPU Scheduling Algorithms Simulation

This project simulates three CPU scheduling algorithms: First-Come, First-Served (FCFS), Shortest Job First (SJF), and Multi-Level Feedback Queue (MLFQ).

## Files in this project

- `main.py`: The entry point of the program
- `scheduler.py`: Abstract base class for schedulers
- `process.py`: Class representing individual processes
- `fcfs.py`: Implementation of First-Come, First-Served algorithm
- `sjf.py`: Implementation of Shortest Job First algorithm
- `mlfq.py`: Implementation of Multi-Level Feedback Queue algorithm

## How to run the simulation

1. Ensure you have Python 3.12 installed on your system.
2. Clone this repository or download the source files.
3. Open a terminal and navigate to the project directory.
4. Run the following command:

   ```bash
